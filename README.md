# intellij-rome

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Rome isn't maintained anymore. [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) is picking up where Rome left off, which has [work being done on its IntelliJ plugin](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/185).

<!-- Plugin description -->
A very basic – and unofficial – https://rome.tools plugin for JetBrains IDEs.
<!-- Plugin description end -->
I have no intention of uploading this to the plugin marketplace as this is my first time using Kotlin let alone writing an IDE plugin, so I'd expect things to be very poor.

## Installation

  Download the [latest release](https://github.com/magnetardev/intellij-rome/releases/latest) and install it manually using
  <kbd>Settings/Preferences</kbd> > <kbd>Plugins</kbd> > <kbd>⚙️</kbd> > <kbd>Install plugin from disk...</kbd>
